# EXIOBASE-clustering
## Some work trying to find some patterns from the EXIOBASE activities or processes by using brightway2 and machine learing algorithms.
### 1. Making LCA Inventory scores as features, trying to use PCA and different clustering methods to cluster the samples.
### 2. Making LCA scores from different LCIA methods as features.
### 3. Adding the location as a feature with inventory scores.
